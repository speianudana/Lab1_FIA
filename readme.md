# Expert System

## Introduction - the project's aim

Expert system is a system that would allow the user to answer some questions about a
possible tourist. A research must be done about the types of tourists that visit Luna-City and collect a database of
at least 5 tourist types, and the criteria by which they can be distinguished from Loonies
and between themselves. If the set of given answers matches a type of tourist from the database, this
should be the systemâ€™s answer. If on the other hand, the system determines that the person
in question is a Loonie, the answer should be returned accordingly.
