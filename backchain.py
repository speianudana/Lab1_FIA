# This function, which you need to write, takes in a hypothesis
# that can be determined using a set of rules, and outputs a goal
# tree of which statements it would need to test to prove that
# hypothesis. Refer to the problem set (section 2) for more
# detailed specifications and examples.

# Note that this function is supposed to be a general
# backchainer.  You should not hard-code anything that is
# specific to a particular rule set.  The backchainer will be
# tested on things other than ZOOKEEPER_RULES.
